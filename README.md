This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews using the BERT-base-multilingual-uncased model. The model predicts ratings on a scale of 1 to 5 stars and supports six languages: English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish, and Italian. The dataset was collected via web scraping and preprocessed for model evaluation.
